# PCAD (Particle CAD)

## PCAD is live [here](https://juliancoy.us/pcad/).

PCAD uses particle physics to generate meshes from mathematically defined shapes. It has applications in 3D modeling for production. 

Inspired by the OpenSCAD modelling tool, PCAD presents a novel approach to the resolution of mathematically defined shapes (in this case Signed Distance Funtions, SDFs) into triangle meshes fit for visualization and 3d printing.  Inspired in part by the physical approach of diffusion models, and also cosmomimicry of electron and gravity physics, this WebGPU browser tool currently resolves the shape of a cylinder using a particle engine.

## TODO:
1) Resolution of the point-cloud into a watertight mesh
2) Additional shapes - Cubes, Bezier Curves, 
3) Differences between shapes a la CGAL / OpenSCAD
